Create your first Landscape application IV
===========================================

This is the fourth part of the Getting Started series.

Some (more) Templating
----------------------

This will be a very short part, as you should already know how to do this task:
You can use this part to check if you understood the basic workflow when creating
Landscape Views.

Create Route
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Add the following line to your router:

``['/show/{id:int}', 'Landscape\showItem'],``

The only difference is that we have now specified a parameter called id of the
type ``int``. You can also add untyped parameters. The parameter will be passed
to the ``$args`` array of our renderer.


Create Renderer
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Our new render function will be:

.. code-block:: PHP

    function showItem($url, $args)
     {
        $context = ['note' => new Note('find', 'ID='.$a['id'])];
        $e = new TemplateEngine('html/show.html', $context);
        print($e->renderStart());
     }

It will use a new template but will also pass the requested Note object to
the template renderer.

The Template
~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. code-block:: HTML

    <html>
        <head>
            <title> {{ note->getTitle }} </title>
        </head>
        <body>
            <h1> Note #{{ note->getID }}</h1>
            <h3> {{ note->getTitle }} </h3>
            <hr>
            <p>
                {{ note->getBody }}
            </p>
        </body>
    </head>


Petty simple isn't it?
If you now run your app, you will see that you can access your created Notes and
:doc:`next part <05>`
view their content. In the  we will take a look on how we can add a
way for the user to add a Note via the page and not via accessing the Database.
