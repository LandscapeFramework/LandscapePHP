Create your first Landscape application II

This is the second part of the Getting Started series.

Hello World and Hello Database
-------------------------------


Creating a simple Hello World Renderer
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

First, just create a simple ``index.php`` with the following content:

.. code-block:: php

  <?php namespace Landscape;

    require_once('vendor/landscape/landscape.php.model/DatabaseModel.php');
    require_once('vendor/landscape/landscape.php.router/Router.php');
    require_once('vendor/landscape/landscape.php.template/TemplateEngine.php');

    function indexRender($url, $args)
    {
        print("Hello World!");
    }

    //ENTRY POINT
    $router = new Router(Array(

        ['/', 'Landscape\indexRender'],

    ));

    $router->run($_SERVER['REQUEST_URI']);
  ?>

Now, if you go to ``localhost`` in your webbrowser you should see ``Hello World!``
as output. You will notice that if you go to another page, like ``localhost/foo``
that there will be no output at all, as we do not have a handler for that.

Now, How does this script work?

At the begining of the script (ENTRY POINT) you will see that we have created a
router. A ``Router`` object is nothing more that an object which can call a callback
whenever you insert an URL. But if the router does not find a match for the URL,
it will not call any callback, so you will see nothing.

Our callback is ``indexRender``. It takes two parameters, the first one contains
the requested URL and the second one the passed arguments, but we will come to
that later.
