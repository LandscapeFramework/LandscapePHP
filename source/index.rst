What is Landscape?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Landscape is an open source web framework. It is inspired by Django, but we try
to create a unique framework which will be easy to use and portable.
We think that PHP is the optimal language for this tasks, as it is compatible
with many webservers and it is somehow the language of the web.

The documentation will be divided into a 3 main parts:

#. :doc:`Getting Started <gettingStarted>`
